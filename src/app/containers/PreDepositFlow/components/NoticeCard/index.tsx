                contribution of 0.1 BTC. Once the Origin pre-order is concluded,
                your pre-deposit will be applied and converted to SOV at the
                closing price of the Origin pre-order, subject to SIP-006

                The closing price of the Origin pre-order will be determined at

                According to the auction model outlined in SIP-0006 the price
                per SOV will close anywhere between 3,000 -10,000 sats per SOV.
                By pre-depositing your BTC, you accept that the conversion price
                to SOV may fall anywhere in this range!
